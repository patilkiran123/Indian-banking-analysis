## What's This About? ðŸ¤”

Imagine HDFC Bank is a race car speeding through the busy traffic of Indian banking. I built this custom dashboard â€“ a powerful tool â€“ to help us see how we're doing compared to other banks in this race.

## How I Pulled It Off: ðŸ’»

Data scraped from the RBI website covering April 2022 to March 2023 gave me the insights I needed. But it wasn't just raw numbers, I used sophisticated techniques:

- **Selenium WebDriver:** This automated robot interacted with the RBI website, navigating its dynamic pages and clicking through menus to find the right data.

- **Requests Library:** Once I had the links to the relevant Excel files, this library downloaded them for me, bringing the data right to my fingertips.

## Update: Data Cleaning Done! âœ¨

The scraped raw data has been successfully cleaned and processed. This crucial step ensures data accuracy and consistency for meaningful analysis. Here's what's been accomplished:

- Removal of irrelevant or redundant columns.
- Handling of missing or inconsistent data points.
- Standardization of column names for clarity and consistency.

## Next Steps: ðŸš§

With the data now in a clean and structured format, the next steps include:

- **Dashboard Development:** Building an interactive and visually compelling dashboard to showcase key insights.
- **Filtering Functionalities:** Enabling users to focus on specific data subsets (cards, banks, months).
- **Data Export Capabilities:** Allowing users to download raw data for further analysis.
- **Testing and Refinement:** Fine-tuning the dashboard for optimal performance and user experience.
- **Deployment for User Access:** Making the dashboard readily available to relevant HDFC Bank teams.
